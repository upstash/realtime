## Installation

```bash
bun install @upstash/realtime
```

You'll also need a Redis client. Install one of the following:

```bash
# Option 1: Upstash Redis (recommended for serverless)
bun install @upstash/redis

# Option 2: ioredis (for traditional Redis servers)
bun install ioredis
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Configure Redis Client

Upstash Realtime works with both `@upstash/redis` and `ioredis`. Choose the one that fits your needs:

#### Option A: Using @upstash/redis (Recommended for serverless)

```ts
// lib/redis.ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis"

export const redis = new Redis({
  // ðŸ‘‡ grab these from the Upstash Redis dashboard
  url: "https://striking-osprey-20681.upstash.io",
  token: "AVDJAAIjcDEyZ...",
})
```

#### Option B: Using ioredis

```ts
// lib/redis.ts
import Redis from "ioredis"

export const redis = new Redis({
  host: "your-redis-host.com",
  port: 6379,
  password: "your-password",
  // ... other ioredis options
})
```

> **Note:** The library automatically handles separate subscriber connections for ioredis, so you only need to pass a single client instance. No additional configuration is required.

### 2. Define event schema

Define the structure of realtime events in your app.

```ts
// lib/realtime.ts
import { Realtime, InferRealtimeEvents } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { redis } from "./redis"
import z from "zod"

// ðŸ‘‡ later triggered with `realtime.notification.alert.emit()`
const schema = {
  notification: z.object({
    alert: z.string(),
  }),
}


export const realtime = new Realtime({ schema, redis })
export type RealtimeEvents = InferRealtimeEvents<typeof realtime>
```

### 3. Create realtime API endpoint

Create your realtime endpoint under `/api/realtime/route.ts`. It's important that your route matches this path exactly.

```ts
// api/realtime/route.ts
import { handle } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { realtime } from "@/lib"

export const GET = handle({ realtime })
```

### 4. Emit events

```ts
await realtime.notification.alert.emit("Hello world")
```

### 5. Subscribe to events

```tsx
"use client"

import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

export default function MyComponent() {
  useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
    events: {
      notification: {
        // ðŸ‘‡ 100% type-safe
        alert: (data) => console.log(data),
      },
    },
  })

  return <div>Listening for events...</div>
}
```

## Usage

### Serverless Configuration

Serverless functions have execution time limits. The client automatically reconnects before timeout, with Redis Streams guaranteeing that no message is lost.

**If you deploy to Vercel:** Make sure [fluid compute](https://vercel.com/docs/fluid-compute) is enabled for your project. This allows very high timeout limits, even for free users. Also, your functions will not be billed based on open time, but on active CPU time (only while realtime messages are processed).

```ts
export const realtime = new Realtime({
  schema,
  redis,

  // ðŸ‘‡ Set to - Vercel free plan: 300; Vercel pro plan: 800
  maxDurationSecs: 300,
})
```

Match this to your API route timeout:

```ts
// api/realtime/route.ts

// ðŸ‘‡ Set to - Vercel free plan: 300; Vercel pro plan: 800
export const maxDuration = 300

export const GET = handle({ realtime })
```

**Vercel Note:** With fluid compute (default), you're only billed for active CPU time, not connection duration. This makes Upstash Realtime very cost-efficient.

### Channels

Scope events to channels or rooms:

```ts
await realtime.channel("room-123").notification.alert.emit("Hello")
```

```tsx
import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
  channel: "room-123",
  events: {
    notification: {
      alert: (data) => console.log(data),
    },
  },
})
```

### History API

Access historical messages and chain with live subscriptions:

```ts
const channel = realtime.channel("room-123")

const messages = await channel.history({ length: 50 })
console.log(messages)

await channel.history({ length: 50 }).on("notification.alert", (data) => {
  console.log(data)
})
```

The history API returns a chainable promise that:
- When awaited directly, returns an array of historical messages
- When chained with `.on()`, first delivers all historical messages matching the event, then subscribes to live updates

**Use Case 1: Just fetch history**
```ts
const messages = await realtime.channel("chat").history({ length: 100 })
```

**Use Case 2: History + live updates**
```ts
await realtime
  .channel("chat")
  .history({ length: 100 })
  .on("message.sent", (data) => {
    console.log("Message:", data)
  })
```

Parameters:
- `length`: Maximum number of messages to retrieve (most recent first)
- `since`: Retrieve messages since a specific timestamp

### Connection Control

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { useRealtime } from "@upstash/realtime/client"
import type { RealtimeEvents } from "@/lib/realtime"

const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(true)

const { status } = useRealtime<RealtimeEvents>({
  enabled,
  events: {
    notification: {
      alert: (data) => console.log(data),
    },
  },
})
```

## Advanced

### Middleware Authentication

Protect your realtime endpoints with custom authentication logic.

```ts
import { realtime } from "@/lib"
import { handle } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { currentUser } from "@/auth"

export const GET = handle({
  realtime,
  middleware: async ({ request, channel }) => {
    const user = await currentUser(request)

    if (channel === user.id) {
      return
    }

    if (channel !== user.id) {
      return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })
    }
  },
})
```

The middleware function receives:

- `request`: The incoming Request object
- `channel`: The channel the client is attempting to connect to

Return `undefined` or nothing to allow the connection. Return a `Response` object to block the connection with a custom error.

### Redis Client Compatibility

Upstash Realtime automatically detects which Redis client you're using and adapts accordingly. Both clients are fully supported:

**@upstash/redis**
- HTTP-based, perfect for serverless environments
- No persistent connections needed
- Works with Upstash Redis (REST API)

**ioredis**
- Traditional TCP connection
- Works with any Redis server (self-hosted, AWS, etc.)
- Full Redis Cluster and Sentinel support
- Automatic pub/sub connection handling (dedicated subscriber connections are managed internally)

The library provides a unified interface, so your application code remains the same regardless of which client you use. Simply pass your configured Redis client to the `Realtime` constructor:

```ts
import { Realtime } from "@upstash/realtime"
import { redis } from "./redis" // Can be either @upstash/redis or ioredis

export const realtime = new Realtime({ 
  schema, 
  redis // Automatically detected!
})
```

**Pub/Sub Connection Management**

When using ioredis, the library automatically creates dedicated connections for pub/sub operations. This is necessary because ioredis requires separate connections for subscription and command operations. The library handles all connection lifecycle management transparently, including:
- Automatic creation of subscriber connections
- Proper cleanup and disconnection on unsubscribe
- Memory leak prevention through handler cleanup

No additional configuration is needed from your application.

**Type Safety**

All adapter types are exported for advanced use cases:

```ts
import type { 
  AnyRedisClient,
  RedisAdapter,
  SubscriberAdapter,
  PipelineAdapter,
  TrimConfig 
} from "@upstash/realtime"
```
